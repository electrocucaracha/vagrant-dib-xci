# DIB XCI on Vagrant

This is an alternative to build DIB images thru Virtual Machines. It
also collects some prerequisites required for the *do_build.sh*
script and support for execution behind a corporate proxy.

## Execution

    $ vagrant up <ubuntu|centos|opensuse>

### Note:

The images generated during this process will be placed into
**shared/** host folder.
